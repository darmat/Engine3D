# Engine3D
Final project for a Computer Graphics class. A simple combustion engine is animated using OpenGL and C++.

The engine model is composed by:
- a support
- a piston
- a transmission
- a flywheel

All the modeling of geometric parts was done with OpenGL primitives.

## Options

The user can interact with the animation with the keyboard:
- arrow keys: change POV
- "a": CCW rotation
- "z": CW rotation
- "+": speed up
- "-": slow down
- "s": shadow toggle
- "d": texture toggle
- space bar: animation toggle
- "f": transparency toggle

In alternative an on screen menu will appear after a mouse click.
